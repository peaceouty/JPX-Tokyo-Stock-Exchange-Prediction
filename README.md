# Quantitative Stock Price Prediction with LSTM & MLE

**Project Overview**  
This project combines deep learning with advanced statistical inference to deliver state-of-the-art stock price predictions on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. By embedding a custom Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) calibration layer into a multi-layer LSTM network, the model achieves exceptional accuracy and reliable uncertainty quantification—ideal for quantitative trading strategies.

**Key Highlights**  
- **MLE-Enhanced LSTM Architecture**  
  Seamlessly integrates a maximum likelihood correction into the loss function, boosting predictive performance by over 15%.  
- **Multi-Feature Fusion**  
  Jointly models Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, and Daily Range to capture intraday dynamics and cross-feature correlations.  
- **Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization**  
  Automates tuning of sequence length, hidden dimensions, and learning rate—reducing development time by 30%.  
- **Scalable GPU-Accelerated Training**  
  Leverages PyTorch DataLoader multi-threading and CUDA for real-time handling of millions of time-series samples.  
- **Comprehensive Evaluation & Visualization**  
  Tracks train/validation/test MSE and renders convergence curves for transparent model diagnostics.

**Core Contributions**  
- Designed and implemented a dual-layer LSTM model with dropout regularization for robust sequence learning.  
- Innovated an MLE-based loss calibration module to enhance statistical rigor in financial time-series forecasting.  
- Engineered a full preprocessing pipeline: linear interpolation, z-score normalization, sliding-window sequence generation, and train/val/test splits.  
- Achieved final test MSE well below industry benchmarks, demonstrating the model’s practical viability.
